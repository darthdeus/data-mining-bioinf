!Series_summary	"Co-expression of genes that physically cluster together is a common characteristic of eukaryotic transcriptomes.  Identifying these groups of co-expressed genes is important to the functional annotation of genomes and understanding the evolutionary fates of the clustered genes."
!Series_summary	"We used microarrays to measure gene expression in seven closely related Drosophila species, to identify domains clusters within a species of Drosophila (D. simulans) and that are evolving among species in the D. melanogater subgroup."
!Series_summary	"Keywords: species comparison"
!Series_overall_design	"Assays were carried out on three independent (biological) replicates per species for a single line of the following five species: D.yakuba (Tuscon Stock Center Number: 14021-0261.00), D.santomea (TSCN: 14021-0271.00), D.teissieri (TSCN: 14021-0257.00), D.mauritiana (David 105, TSCN: 14021-0241.01), D.sechellia (Roberstson, TSCN: 14021-0248.21). Three biological replicates for D.melanogaster.  The samples assayed for D.melanogaster reflect an even genotypic contribution of 10 isogenic lines developed from a wild population (Winters, CA) and crossed in a round-robin design.For D. simulans, three replicate arrays were used to assay each of 10 round-robin crosses between 10 isogenic lines developed from the same population.  the entire data set therefore included a total of 48 independent transcript assays covering seven Drosophila species in the D.melanogaster subgroup"
